This is a content based movie reccomendation system that includes a dataset of 5000 movies. 
This system will only run if the movie is in the data set. 
Examples that work include "The Dark Knight Rises" or "The Avengers"

For this code to run, you will need to install the sklearn package
The link below shows you how to install the SKlearn package on a Macos system

In order to run the code, type "python3 final.py" in the terminal. 
You should then wait for the script to load and ask "input a movie that you have enjoyed, and the system will return similar movies to that title."

Then input one of the examples in line 4 of this README file or any other movie in the dataset

The script will then print 10 movies similar to the title you inputted
